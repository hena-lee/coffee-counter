Recreate the Crab Fan Site, but with one of your own interests. This fan site should include:

An appropriate title and top-level heading
A thematically-appropriate background and text colors
An "Add Thing" feature:
A button that is titled "Add Thing," where "Thing" is relevant to your interest
When the button is clicked, an element is added to the DOM and becomes visible
A "Thing Counter" feature:
An element whose text displays the number of "Thing"s there are
This text updates every time the "Add Thing" button is clicked
Create a "Dark mode/Light mode" feature, or a feature that changes the appearance of your site. Here are some tips:

Create a button that turns on "Theme 1."
When the button is clicked, it adds or removes specific classes from different HTML elements. These classes should determine background and text colors.
Create a button that turns on "Theme 2."
When this button is clicked, different classes are added or removed from the HTML. The site will have different background and text colors.
